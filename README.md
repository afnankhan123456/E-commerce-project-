# E-commerce-project-

This project is an E-commerce data analysis where multiple datasets (customers, orders, products, reviews, and marketing) were combined to extract insights.

First, 10 tables were loaded from Google BigQuery, then cleaned and merged for key analyses:
	•	Churn Analysis – identifying which customers stopped buying,
	•	RFM Segmentation – grouping customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value,
	•	CLV Calculation – calculating each customer’s lifetime value,

Conversion Funnel Analysis - tracking drop-offs at each stage of the purchase journey,
﻿﻿Price Elasticity - analyzing how changes in price affect demand.
Visualizations were created to understand the data, including RFM scatter plots, conversion funnel charts, CLV distributions, and churn comparison plots.
